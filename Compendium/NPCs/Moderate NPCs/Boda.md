### Description
Boda is a cleric of the goddess [[Xonera]] and healer who works at the [[Healer's Guild]] and specialises in soul magic. She is also a senior member of the [[Cult of the Primeval]] and has been manipulated by [[Anec]] into helping bring about [[Il'Zuk's Plan]]. They are planning to drug the members of the [[Cult of the Primeval|Cult]] during their founding festival meeting at the shrine to [[Kairos]] and drain the remaining time from their souls to create the [[Bottle of Age]]. [[Boda]]'s soul magic expertise is an important part of this process. Though she has been told by [[Anec]] that this is the first step in the summoning ritual for the primeval [[Kairos]] and will give [[Boda]] the [[Mark of the Primevals#The Mark of Kairos|Mark of Kairos]].

During [[Session ?]], she was recruited by [[Mayastan Daar|Daar]] to help heal [[Phoenix Aevum|Phoenix]]'s soul after it was damaged fighting [[Il'Zuk]] in [[Arc 1 Session 1|1.1 An Old Friend - A New Enemy]]. During the healing process she saw the [[Mark of the Primevals#The Mark of Kairos|Mark of Kairos]] in [[Phoenix Aevum|Phoenix]]'s soul and, knowing only one person can have the mark at at time, she believed they had stolen her chance at getting the mark and turned on them. But the loop was reset by [[Mayastan Daar|Daar]]'s breath attack killing a weakened [[Phoenix Aevum|Phoenix]].

[[Anec]] would kill Boda after the ritual was complete. In [[Arc 1 Session 10|1.10 Save The Cat - Kill The Bird]], she would rise as undead and slaughter civilians inside the [[Kiriel's Whisper]] before [[Mayastan Daar|Daar]] and [[Phoenix Aevum|Phoenix]] would kill her and store her body in the ring, **Redacted.**
