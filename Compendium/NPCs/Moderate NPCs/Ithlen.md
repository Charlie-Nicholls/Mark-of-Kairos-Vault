### Description
Ithlen is one of [[Hestrela]]'s premier archmages and the leader of the city of [[Camarath]]. She is driven by dreams of fame and power, to raise the status of her city and herself to one of the most powerful in [[Lothlonde]]. After the defeat of [[Comrath]] she used magic to enslave [[Laune]], keeping her around for protection, as a status symbol and forcing her to use her connection to [[Diracmi]] to allow [[Camarath]] to flourish. Without interference, in each loop when [[Il'Zuk]] rises she attempts to stand against him but is killed, freeing [[Laune]].
