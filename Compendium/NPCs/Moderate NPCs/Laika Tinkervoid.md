# Profile

> [!recite|clean no-t]
>	A gnome woman with dark skin and messy brown hair. A vacant expression on her face, her eyes staring at something that isn't there. Around her neck lies a neckless which holds an infinite hourglass and on her finger an ornate ring with a gem prominently embedded into its centre.
