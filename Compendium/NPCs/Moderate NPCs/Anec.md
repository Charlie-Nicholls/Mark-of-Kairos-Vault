# Profile

> [!recite|clean no-t]
>	A dark shape in the shadows, a rush of wind behind you, something moving in the corner of your eye. Anec lives in the whispers and legends of Camarath, only allowing himself to seen on special occasions. But his influence on the city is undeniable; those working against the Hand of Twilight tend to disappear when they enter the shadows.
>^IntroText

### Description
Anec is one of the member of the [[Hand of Twilight]] who run [[Camarath]]. He is also leader of the [[Cult of the Primeval]]. He operates in the shadows, assassinating any who stand against the Hand. He once sought to gain the [[Mark of the Primevals|Mark of Scathach]] and travelled to the [[Shrine to Scathach]] in the [[Desolation of Suuhulla]] to summon them and become their chosen a few years ago. However, since [[Il'Zuk]] was not dead, and only one may have the mark at once, the ritual failed and corrupted his soul, allowing [[Scathach]] to turn him into an undead servant of [[Il'Zuk]]. Ever since he has been working to prepare for and hasten his return, his undead nature is hidden behind illusions caused by his [[Amulet of Nystul]].

He summons many of the [[Cult of the Primeval]] to [[Ulrach]]'s on the morning of the founding festival, drugging them and draining their soul's time into a [[Bottle of Age]]. He then goes to the [[Camarath Observatory|Observatory]] and forces [[Mata Starheart|Mata]] to map out [[The Dark Storm]], driving her mad in the process. When [[Il'Zuk]] rises he gives him the [[Bottle of Age]] and Map of [[The Dark Storm]], before turning on the rest of the [[Hand of Twilight]]. In the default timeline he kills [[Maera]] before being killed by [[Laune]].
