# Profile

> [!recite|clean no-t]
>	A dark shape in the shadows, a rush of wind behind you, something moving in the corner of your eye. Anec lives in the whispers and legends of Camarath, only allowing himself to seen on special occasions. But his influence on the city is undeniable; those working against the Hand of Twilight tend to disappear when they enter the shadows.
>^IntroText

### Description
Anec is one of the member of the [[Hand of Twilight]] who run [[Camarath]]. He is also leader of the [[Cult of the Primeval]]. He operates in the shadows, assassinating any who stand against the Hand. **Redacted Personal History**

He summons many of the [[Cult of the Primeval]] to [[Ulrach]]'s on the morning of the founding festival, drugging them and draining their soul's time into a [[Bottle of Age]]. He then goes to the [[Camarath Observatory|Observatory]] and forces [[Mata Starheart|Mata]] to map out [[The Dark Storm]], driving her mad in the process. When [[Il'Zuk]] rises he gives him the [[Bottle of Age]] and Map of [[The Dark Storm]], before turning on the rest of the [[Hand of Twilight]]. In [[Arc 1 Session 1]], [[Mayastan Daar|Daar]] saw his dead body as she traversed the city, bearing severe slashing wounds.
