### Description
**Redacted**

In [[Arc 1 Session 9]], she met [[Mayastan Daar|Daar]] and [[Phoenix Aevum|Phoenix]] in [[Hawker's Caverns]] after she fled, injured, from [[Il'Zuk]]'s attack. She seemed amiable to the group, but needed to rest and heal and would not return to the surface with them. Initial attempts to communicate with her failed, but [[Mayastan Daar|Daar]] eventually discovered she understood draconic.
