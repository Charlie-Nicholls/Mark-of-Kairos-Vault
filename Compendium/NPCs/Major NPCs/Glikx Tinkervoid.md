### Description
Glikx Tinkervoid is the chosen of the primeval [[Vacuuous]], originally born hundreds of years ago, he has been lost in time along with his home city of [[Kaldera]] since attempting to save it from volcanic eruption. His older sister [[Laika Tinkervoid|Laika]] had the gift of prophecy and was chosen at a young age to be the chosen of [[Kairos]]. Glikx however, was always fascinated by space and technology, working to become the premier artificer of his age. Eventually building a shuttle that would take him to space where he could summon [[Vacuuous]] and claim the [[Mark of the Primevals|Mark of Vacuuous]], becoming the first chosen of [[Vacuuous]] in nearly a century after the previous chosen died without passing it on.

After claiming the mark, he began working spatial magic into his creations. Starting with inventing the extradimensional [[Goldfish Sphere]], he would later move on to creating a full extradimensional space using a [[Hyperbolic Gem]] that he would gift to his sister in the form of the [[Ring of Glikx]]. By combining his spatial magic and engineering talents with [[Laika Tinkervoid|Laika]]'s temporal magic he would create a system of space-time manipulation engines that would be used to power the flying ship he would later use in the battle against [[Il'Zuk]]. He would strip the time engines to use to contact [[Phoenix Aevum|Phoenix]] & [[Mayastan Daar|Daar]] in [[Arc 1 Session 9 (2024-11-13)|See The Past - Speak The Future]] and the repurpose the spatial components of the ship to adapt the [[Great Sword Supernova]] to power an extradimensional prison for [[Il'Zuk]] that became [[The Eternal Pillar]]. 

When his home city of [[Kaldera]], was set to be destroyed by volcanic eruption, he would retrieve the time engines from the [[Shrine to Diracmi]] and combine them with a future iteration of his spatial technology to create engines capable of creating a space-time envelop large enough to temporarily lift the entire city of [[Kaldera]] into the air for long enough to fly it to a new place in the world to settle. However, without [[Laika Tinkervoid|Laika]] or another chosen of [[Kairos]] to lend their magic to the machinery, when it started to fail, it couldn't be repaired. As a result, Glikx and the city of [[Kaldera]] began to phase and fall through time, becoming known as [[Kaldera|The Lost City]].
