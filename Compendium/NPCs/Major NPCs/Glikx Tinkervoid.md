### Description
Glikx Tinkervoid is the chosen of the primeval [[Vacuuous]], originally born hundreds of years ago, he has been lost in time along with his home city of [[Kaldera]] since **Redacted**. His older sister [[Laika Tinkervoid|Laika]] had the gift of prophecy and was chosen at a young age to be the chosen of [[Kairos]]. **Redacted Personal History**

After claiming the mark, he began working spatial magic into his creations. Starting with inventing the extradimensional [[Goldfish Sphere]], he would later move on to creating a full extradimensional space using a [[Hyperbolic Gem]] that he would gift to his sister in the form of the [[Ring of Glikx]]. By combining his spatial magic and engineering talents with [[Laika Tinkervoid|Laika]]'s temporal magic he would create a system of space-time manipulation engines that would be used to power the flying ship he would later use in the battle against [[Il'Zuk]]. He would strip the time engines to use to contact [[Phoenix Aevum|Phoenix]] & [[Mayastan Daar|Daar]] in [[Arc 1 Session 9|See The Past - Speak The Future]] and **Redacted**
