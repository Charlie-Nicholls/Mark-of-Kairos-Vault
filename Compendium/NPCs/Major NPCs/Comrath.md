### Description
Comrath is the chosen of [[Diracmi]], and has been for many thousands of years. Many years ago she and the other two chosen of the time, [[Glikx Tinkervoid|Glikx]] and [[Laika Tinkervoid]], fought [[Il'Zuk]] to stop his wave of destruction. [[Laika Tinkervoid|Laika]] was lost before their final confrontation, and with no way to kill [[Il'Zuk]] without the chosen of [[Kairos]], she and [[Glikx Tinkervoid|Glikx]] used the time engine from their ship to contact [[Phoenix Aevum|Phoenix]] and [[Mayastan Daar|Daar]] in the future. With no solution to kill [[Il'Zuk]] found, they instead trapped him inside [[The Eternal Pillar]] on their final confrontation on [[Comrath]].

She would then guard his prison for thousands of years **Redacted**
  
A hundred or so years ago, nearby human colonies discovered the magic of the island and sought to oust Comrath from the island so they could settle there. After several parties were killed, they struck a deal with the [[Hand of Twilight]], that they would slay the dragon and in return be given positions of power in the city that would be built. **Redacted.** After she was killed, the city was named Camarath after her, and her crystal bones are displayed in the [[Crystal Dragon Library]] and the story of her defeat told on the day of the founding festival.
