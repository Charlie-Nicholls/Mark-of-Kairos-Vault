### Description
Comrath is the chosen of [[Diracmi]], and has been for many thousands of years. [[Diracmi]]'s mark behaves slightly differently to the others, where instead of passing the mark on, new chosen become a part of the mark, lending their wisdom, personality and form to the whole. Many years ago she, along with the other two chosen of the time, [[Glikx]] and [[Laika Tinkervoid]], fought [[Il'Zuk]] to stop his wave of destruction. [[Laika Tinkervoid|Laika]] was lost before their final confrontation, and with no way to kill [[Il'Zuk]] without the chosen of [[Kairos]], she and [[Glikx Tinkervoid|Glikx]] used the time engine from their ship to contact [[Phoenix Aevum|Phoenix]] and [[Mayastan Daar|Daar]] in the future. With no solution to kill [[Il'Zuk]] found, they instead modified the [[Great Sword Supernova]] into an extradimensional prison and trapped him inside on their final confrontation on [[Comrath]].

  She would then guard his prison for thousands of years, breathing life into [[The Eternal Pillar|Il'Zuk's Prison]] to keep its defences from decaying. She kept to herself and allowed the legend of the marks to fade, only appearing to fight when her or the prison. Her and [[Glikx Tinkervoid|Glikx]] had concocted a plan to kill [[Il'Zuk]] when [[Phoenix Aevum|Phoenix]] eventually arrived on [[Comrath]]. They would pull him into a powerful extradimensional space, based on the hyperbolic gem used in the [[Ring of Glikx]]. and use the combined power of the marks to create a new universe, beyond the reach of the [[Primevals]]. In this realm, [[Scathach]] would not be able to grand the immortality usual to those who bear the [[Mark of the Primevals#The Mark of Scathach|Mark of Scathach]]. To this end she created [[Laune|The Spark of Life]], the living embodiment of the creation element of [[Diracmi]]'s domain, and one component required to start the [[Small Bang]]. 
  
  [[Laune|The Spark of Life]]'s aura would create a field of life around the island of [[Camarath]] which caused greater crop yields, resistance to disease, improved healing magic etc... A hundred or so years ago, nearby human colonies discovered the magic of the island and sought to oust Comrath from the island so they could settle there. After several parties were killed, they struck a deal with the [[Hand of Twilight]], that they would slay the dragon and in return be given positions of power in the city that would be built. [[Anec]], a servant of [[Scathach]] and member of the [[Hand of Twilight]], would kill her in the fight. Made possible by the [[Entropic Dagger]] [[Scathach]] had given to him, which was designed specifically to counter the atomic magic of [[Diracmi]] and weaken the dragon. The city was named Camarath after her, and her crystal bones are displayed in the [[Crystal Dragon Library]] and the story of her defeat told on the day of the founding festival.
