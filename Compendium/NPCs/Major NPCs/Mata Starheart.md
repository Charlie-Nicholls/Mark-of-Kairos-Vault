### Description
Mata is the most senior astral scryer in [[Camarath]] and the director of [[Camarath Observatory]]. She also maintains the [[Shrine to Diracmi]] and is secretly a member of the [[Cult of the Primeval]]. In majority of loops, she was told by [[Anec]] to meet him at the [[Shrine to Diracmi]] at midday where he tied her up and forced her to create the map of [[The Dark Storm]] that would be used in [[Il'Zuk's Plan]]. This process would drive her mad. In [[Session ?]], [[Mayastan Daar|Daar]] talked to her and told her about [[Il'Zuk]]'s rise and the time-loop. When she was shown proof of this she agreed to help. Not wanting to be killed in the fighting she hid in the [[Ring of Glikx]] at the end of the loop, leading to the discovery that people or objects kept in the ring were preserved between loops. She is now allied with [[Mayastan Daar|Daar]] and [[Phoenix Aevum|Phoenix]] and working to defeat [[Il'Zuk]].
