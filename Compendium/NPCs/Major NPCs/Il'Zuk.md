# Profile

> [!recite|clean no-t]
>	A skeletal hand appears from the ruins of the pillar. Fingers clutching at the ground, clawing upwards as a figure rises from the earth. While from a distance it may look like an ordinary skeleton, up close a power glows in the sockets of its eyes. It takes a step onto solid ground before it looks around, its jaw opens and closes and its head tilts. It then beckons towards the dead body of a nearby half-orc, which slowly gets to its feet and takes slow, lumbering steps towards the skeleton. When it's about 30 feet away it stops, bones begin to crack through its chest as it splits open before his lungs start to float out. These are followed by his tongue and part of his neck which also float over to the skeleton, who's rib cage has opened in a twisted embrace as the organs slot there way into place. Finally part of the half-orcs lips and face slot into place over its mouth and it opens once again and speaks. "I am the chosen of Scath-, hmm, new tongue, that's weird."

### Description

**Redacted Personal History**

**Redacted Rise To Power**

**Redacted Master Plan**

The chosen of the other primevals, [[Comrath]], [[Laika Tinkervoid|Laika]] and [[Glikx Tinkervoid|Glikx]] would stand against him. Eventually cumulating in a battle on the island that would become [[Comrath]] in which [[Comrath]] and [[Glikx Tinkervoid|Glikx]] would trap him in an extradimensional prison inside the [[Great Sword Supernova]]. 

He would stay trapped for many years, his prison becoming known as [[The Eternal Pillar]]. He would use his entropic powers to slowly break down the confinement magic of the pillar, **Redacted**. He finally breaks free on the day of the founding festival, collapsing [[The Eternal Pillar]], casting *False Resurrection* on [[Comrath]], and using the map of [[The Dark Storm]] and [[Bottle of Age]] to summon [[The Dark Storm]] to [[Camarath]] where **Redacted**.
