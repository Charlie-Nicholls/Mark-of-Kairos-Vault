# Profile

> [!recite|clean no-t]
>	A skeletal hand appears from the ruins of the pillar. Fingers clutching at the ground, clawing upwards as a figure rises from the earth. While from a distance it may look like an ordinary skeleton, up close a power glows in the sockets of its eyes. It takes a step onto solid ground before it looks around, its jaw opens and closes and its head tilts. It then beckons towards the dead body of a nearby half-orc, which slowly gets to its feet and takes slow, lumbering steps towards the skeleton. When it's about 30 feet away it stops, bones begin to crack through its chest as it splits open before his lungs start to float out. These are followed by his tongue and part of his neck which also float over to the skeleton, who's rib cage has opened in a twisted embrace as the organs slot there way into place. Finally part of the half-orcs lips and face slot into place over its mouth and it opens once again and speaks. "I am the chosen of Scath-, hmm, new tongue, that's weird."

### Description
Born Iltar Zukarrus in the town of [[Shrine to Scathach|Sshara]], Il'Zuk was a prodigiously talented wizard, with a particular affinity for soul magic. He studied in [[Desolation of Suuhulla|Suuhulla]]'s capital city [[Kharakzar]], becoming the most powerful soul mage of his age. But the then chosen of [[Kairos]] prophecy had predicted that [[Desolation of Suuhulla|Suuhulla]] would produce someone capable of threatening the gods themselves. This led to the kingdom being shunned by the gods during Il'Zuk's lifetime, seeing drought, famine and natural disasters levied against his homeland. Eventually, with the prophecy unchanged, the gods became desperate and [[Aran]], who was specifically named as the first of the gods to fall, went against the natural laws and intervened directly. 

[[Aran]] sent a wave of death and destruction that consumed [[Desolation of Suuhulla|Suuhulla]], turning its lush forests to desert and wiping out all life for hundreds of miles and creating the [[Desolation of Suuhulla]]. Il'Zuk was killed in this attack and found himself in the afterlife, the swirling mass of souls surrounding [[The Dark Storm]]. It turned out, however, that in this realm of souls, Il'Zuk's mastery of soul magic would make this the perfect environment for him to become more powerful. Siphoning off the magic, power and will of those around him, he would slowly grow in power. All the while, [[Scathach]] would whisper to him, tell him there was a way to avenge the destruction of his homeland, to overthrow the gods and take power for himself. Eventually he grew powerful enough to challenge [[Aran]], overpowering and binding him with the [[Chains of The Damned]], copying the [[Mark of the Primevals#The Mark of Scathach|Mark of Scathach]] from his soul and trapping him beyond the event horizon of [[The Dark Storm]].

With [[Aran]] chained, the boundary between life and death became loosened, allowing for the existence of undead. Il'Zuk rose where he was born in [[Shrine to Scathach|Sshara]] as the first lich, corrupting the land and turning it into a [[Shrine to Scathach]]. He would then begin a campaign of destruction, targeting areas the gods favoured, looking for a way to complete [[Scathach]]'s ultimate goal of unleashing the [[True Vacuum]]. To do so would require his death, but the [[Mark of the Primevals#The Mark of Scathach|Mark of Scathach]] imparts near immortality on those who wear it. He would eventually plant to summon the [[Aran#God of Death]] to the mortal plane to kill him. Before he could realise this plan though, the chosen of the other primevals, [[Comrath]], [[Laika Tinkervoid|Laika]] and [[Glikx Tinkervoid|Glikx]] would stand against him. Eventually cumulating in a battle on the island that would become [[Comrath]] in which [[Comrath]] and [[Glikx Tinkervoid|Glikx]] would trap him in an extradimensional prison inside the [[Great Sword Supernova]]. 

He would stay trapped for many years, his prison becoming known as [[The Eternal Pillar]]. He would use his entropic powers to slowly break down the confinement magic of the pillar, at first able to exert some influence on the world in small ways to set up his plan when he was freed. Most notably by controlling [[Anec]] in tandem with [[Scathach]] to kill [[Comrath]] and create the [[Cult of the Primeval]] that would create the [[Shrine to Kairos]] and [[Shrine to Vacuuous]] that he would need. He finally breaks free on the day of the founding festival, collapsing [[The Eternal Pillar]], casting *False Resurrection* on [[Comrath]], and using the map of [[The Dark Storm]] and [[Bottle of Age]] to summon [[The Dark Storm]] to [[Camarath]] where [[Anec]], still imprisoned, would be controlled by [[Scathach]] through the [[Mark of the Primevals#The Mark of Scathach|Mark of Scathach]] to kill him. With [[True Vacuum]] unleashed, near instantly destroying [[Tellus]], every living creature would die, and the gods with them. Il'Zuk would become the most powerful being in the universe in the realm of souls in the afterlife, able to craft the realm to his will. However, the time-loop created by [[Kairos]] provides hope to prevent this.
