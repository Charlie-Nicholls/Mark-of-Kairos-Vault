### Description
Tela is an arcane trickster first seen outside the [[Kiriel's Whisper]] performing illusions on the street. She is secretly using mage hand to rob the people watching. When [[Mayastan Daar|Daar]] is scheduled to meet [[Phoenix Aevum|Phoenix]], she is robbing [[Vede]] stealing a [[Primeval Token]]. Afterwards she goes to set up her stall in [[Camarath Square]], starting near [[Malla#Carnival Game - Hook a Sea Serpent|Hook a Sea Serpent]] but moving around.

#### Carnival Game - Cup And Ball

**Cost:** Stake up to 5g, returns 2x your stake if you win. (If [[Mayastan Daar|Daar]] bets at least 1 gold she will lay out 3 gold coins as her stake, the top one of which will be the stolen [[Primeval Token]].

Starts with a DC15 Wisdom (Perception) check ostensibly to follow the ball but a success lets you notice she slight of hands the ball away and uses an illusion instead. If the check is failed it is impossible to actually guess correctly.

If called out will play the game legit, a further Wisdom (Perception) check is made to follow the ball. DC15 to find the correct cup, DC10 to eliminate the cup you're supposed to follow leaving a 50% chance of guessing correctly, or random luck (5-6 on D6) if failed completely.

On a Nat 20 Wisdom (Perception) on either check or a DC15 Wisdom (Perception) on winning at least 1 gold coin, they notice the coin is actually not currency but something else with the symbol of the [[Primevals]] on it.
