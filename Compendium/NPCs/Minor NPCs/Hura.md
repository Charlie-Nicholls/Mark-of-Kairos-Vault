### Description
Young healer at the [[Healer's Guild]], on duty for the day of the [[Founding Festival]] in case of emergencies. He is a cleric of [[Zeriel]] and as such is good at physical healing, but bad at soul healing. When [[Phoenix Aevum|Phoenix]] had soul sickness after encountering [[Il'Zuk]] in [[Arc 1 Session 1]], [[Vella]] would take him to [[Phoenix's House]] to try and help [[Phoenix Aevum|Phoenix]] but he was largely ineffective.
