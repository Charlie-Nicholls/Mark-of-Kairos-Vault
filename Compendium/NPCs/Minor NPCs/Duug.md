### Description
Runs the ring toss at centre of [[Camarath Square]] and speaks with a deep enigmatic voice. Knows [[Vede]] who sold him the [[Goldfish Sphere]] to use as a prize to get rid of it.
When [[Il'Zuk]] rises, a shard of the pillar, attracted by the synergistic space magic of the [[Goldfish Sphere]] shoots out at high speed towards it. Without intervention Duug is standing in front of the pillar and is killed. [[Il'Zuk]] steals his vocal system when he awakens.
