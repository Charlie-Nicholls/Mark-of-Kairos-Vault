### Description

Ringly and his wife [[Timble]] are tourists from [[Noorbamblu]] who are in town for the founding festival. As historians, they are interested in and want to visit the [[Hawker's Caverns]]. They go to [[Beggar's Docks]] to hire a boat but the clerics of [[Taranis]] who usually calm the waters to allow trips are busy. So they go to the [[Temple of Taranis]] to ask for one but [[Tiva]] has to turn them down. 

In [[Session ?]] they identify the gnomish signature of [[Glikx Tinkervoid]] on the [[Ring of Glikx]]. [[Daar]] then escorts them to the caverns and find some paintings depicting the fight between [[Il'Zuk]] and [[Comrath]] & [[Glikx Tinkervoid|Glikx]].

In [[Arc 1 Session 8]], they are one again escorted to the caverns but do not go beyond the cordoned off area and are killed by undead giant centipedes when [[Il'Zuk]] rises.
