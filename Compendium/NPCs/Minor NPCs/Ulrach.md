### Description
Run's [[Ulrach's Clock Shop]] in the [[Hill District]]. He is a member of the [[Cult of the Primeval]] and is hosting a meeting on the day of the [[Founding Festival]] at the [[Shrine to Kairos]] under his shop. He ends up in an argument with [[Vede]] in the morning after he is denied entrance to the meeting due to losing his [[Primeval Token]]. Unless changed, he dies to [[Anec]] and [[Boda]]'s plan sacrifice members of the cult in the [[Bottle of Age]] ritual.

In [[Session ?]], [[Mayastan Daar|Daar]] intimidated him into showing him the entrance to the [[Shrine to Kairos]], before knocking him unconscious and leaving him near one of his coocoo clocks.
