### Description
Cult runs the "Ram a Ram" carnival game at the [[Scholar's District]].

#### Carnival Game - Archery Shooting
**Cost:** 1 gp

Runs two times per hour. Try to knock opponents off their mounts. On your turn you can charge with your goat or lasso an opponent. If you get charged make a **DC 5 Dexterity Saving Throw** to remain standing, for each **5 ft.** the goat travels before hitting you add **+1 to DC**. Disadvantage if hit side on. You make an **Wisdom (Animal Handling)** check equal to the DC before, if you fail the opponent gains advantage on the save.

Each rider also has a lasso. If within **15 ft.** of another rider you can make a **Dexterity (Sleight of Hand)** check with disadvantage against the other rider's **Dexterity (Acrobatics)**. Last one standing wins.
