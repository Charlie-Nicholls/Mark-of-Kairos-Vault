### Description
Lici is an astral scryer who runs tours of [[Camarath Observatory]] during the [[Founding Festival]].

In [[Session ?]] he ran the tour for [[Mayastan Daar|Daar]], at the end of which he showed a future scrying of the nearby star of importance to dwarven culture and saw the simulation "break". In reality this was him seeing the effect of [[True Vacuum]] being released and wiping out the star when it reaches it. After [[Mayastan Daar|Daar]] discussed this with him, he wanted to show the broken simulation to [[Mata Starheart|Mata]] and found her missing. When [[Mayastan Daar|Daar]] discovered her in the [[Shrine to Vacuuous]] having gone insane, he would take her to the [[Healer's Guild]].
