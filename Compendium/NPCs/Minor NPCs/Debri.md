### Description

> [!recite|clean no-t]
>	"I do apologise sir, but you were quite insitent on your 9am alarm call - said you had someone to meet. I did try a more gentle approach, knocking and shaking you awake, but nothing seemed to work. I'm relieved quite frankly, I was beginning to think you had died."
