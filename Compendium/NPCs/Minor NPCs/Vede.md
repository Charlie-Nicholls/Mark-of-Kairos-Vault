### Description
Vede is a cleric of [[Binur]], the war god and member of the [[Cult of the Primeval]]. He is first seen at the [[Hill District]] watching [[Tela]] perform illusions and, unbeknownst to him, having his [[Primeval Token]] stolen. He is there to go to the [[Cult of the Primeval]] meeting at the [[Shrine to Kairos]] but, after losing his token, is denied entrance and argues with [[Ulrach]] on the street. After [[Mayastan Daar|Daar]] absorbs the age of souls of several [[Cult of the Primeval|Cult]] members in [[Session ?]], [[Anec]] amends this policy to make up numbers and [[Vede]] is allowed in any subsequent loops. This results in [[Vede]] being killed in the ritual for a [[Bottle of Age]], his body washing ashore in the [[Beggar's Docks]] after it is disposed of.

In [[Arc 1 Session 9]], Vede, having risen as an undead, fought [[Mayastan Daar|Daar]] and [[Phoenix Aevum|Phoenix]] and was defeated easily.
