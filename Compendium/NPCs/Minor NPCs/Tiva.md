### Description
Tiva is the senior cleric at the [[Temple to Taranis]] in [[Storm Haven]]. During the [[Founding Festival]] she, along with some other clerics of [[Taranis]], are performing a ritual to keep the storm raging nearby from reaching the island of [[Camarath]].

In [[Session ?]], [[Mayastan Daar|Daar]] visited the temple and asked her about the [[Primevals]]. Tiva knows the basics, recognised [[Vacuuous]]' Symbol, and explained the difference between [[Primevals]] & Gods. She had also heard rumours of the [[Cult of the Primeval]] but had no interest in joining.

In [[Arc 1 Session 9]] [[Taranis]] directed [[Mayastan Daar|Daar]] to help her in [[Storm Haven]] where he found she had inverted the storm ritual that was usually used to keep the storm away from [[Camarath]] to instead focus a storm around the [[Temple of Taranis]]. This was successfully keeping the undead out, but, with the few clerics they had, it could not be sustained for much longer. Without [[Mayastan Daar|Daar]]'s help finding the clerics who's shift had finished and supplying food and water, she would soon falter, letting the undead in who would kill her and anyone else there as in previous loops. With [[Mayastan Daar|Daar]]'s help, she would shelter the people [[Mayastan Daar|Daar]] and [[Phoenix Aevum|Phoenix]] rescued, allowing them to channel their various associated gods to give [[Mayastan Daar|Daar]] blessings.
