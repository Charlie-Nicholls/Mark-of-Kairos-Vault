### Description
You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon.

You can use an action to cause thick, black entropic mist to coat the blade. The must remains for 1 minute or until an attack using this weapon hits a creature. That creature must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or take 2d10 necrotic damage and become poisoned for 1 minute. The dagger can't be used this way again until you take a long rest.

Proficiency with a Dagger allows you to add your proficiency bonus to the attack roll for any attack you make with it.
