>	An ordinary goldfish inside a sphere of water that's very strange to look at. The goldfish always stays in the centre and the environment around it seems to warp, scattering the light in weird ways.

### Description
Originally created by [[Glikx Tinkervoid]] when he was experimenting with creating spatial magic items. It was designed as a way for his pet fish to live in a large environment whilst being able to keep it on display in his office. It bears his signature in gnomish etched into the bottom of the glass. **Redacted**

In more recent times it was taken by the [[Cult of the Primeval]] due to its connection to the magic of the space primeval [[Vacuuous]]. Recently, at the last meeting of the [[Cult of the Primeval]] which was held at the [[Shrine to Vacuuous]] where it was stored, it was stolen and is now possessed by [[Duug]] who has it available as a prize on his carnival stall. When [[The Eternal Pillar]] collapses, a shard is expelled in the direction of the stand and is pulled towards the Sphere. Unless prevented, [[Duug]] is standing in front of the sphere and is killed by the shard.

In [[Session ?]], [[Mayastan Daar]] won the sphere from [[Duug]] shortly before [[Il'Zuk]]'s rise. She attempted to bring the sphere inside the [[Ring of Glikx]] before running off to find phoenix, but since you can't nest extradimensional spaces, it did not follow her into the ring.

In [[Session ?]], [[Mayastan Daar|Daar]] found the area in the [[Shrine to Vacuuous]] where the sphere was stored and checked the logs for who had been to the shrine recently to obtain a list of potential suspects.

In [[Session ?]], [[Mayastan Daar]] once again won the sphere from [[Duug]] and found the signature. Looking through the bowl at the environment around it, she saw metal, the sky and clouds from close up. She then blasted it until it broke, flooding the street with a torrent of water before the magic collapses in on itself.
