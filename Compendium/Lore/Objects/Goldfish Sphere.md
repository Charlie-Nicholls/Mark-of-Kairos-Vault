>	An ordinary goldfish inside a sphere of water that's very strange to look at. The goldfish always stays in the centre and the environment around it seems to warp, scattering the light in weird ways.

### Description
Originally created by [[Glikx Tinkervoid]] when he was experimenting with creating spatial magic items. It was designed as a way for his pet fish to live in a large environment whilst being able to keep it on display in his office. It bears his signature in gnomish etched into the bottom of the glass. The real space it is linked to is a pond located in his home city of [[Kaldera]]. After the city was lost, the goldfish bowl was kept in what is now [[The Ostirach Empire]] for many centuries, but in peace times was traded through educational institutes who studied the spatial magic it contained.

In more recent times it was taken by the [[Cult of the Primeval]] due to its connection to the magic of the space primeval [[Vacuuous]]. Recently, at the last meeting of the [[Cult of the Primeval]] which was held at the [[Shrine to Vacuuous]] where it was stored, [[Vede]] stole it impulsively while drunk. He later realised what he'd done and, not wanting to be found out, gave it to his friend [[Duug]] to give away on his carnival stall so it wouldn't be traced back to him. When [[The Eternal Pillar]] collapses, a shard is expelled in the direction of the stand. The synergistic spatial magic of [[Vacuuous]] between the sphere an the prison of the pillar creates an attractive force that pulls the shard towards it. Unless prevented, [[Duug]] is standing in front of the sphere and is killed by the shard.

In [[Session ?]], [[Mayastan Daar]] won the sphere from [[Duug]] shortly before [[Il'Zuk]]'s rise. She attempted to bring the sphere inside the [[Ring of Glikx]] before running off to find phoenix, but since you can't nest extradimensional spaces, it did not follow her into the ring.

In [[Session ?]], [[Mayastan Daar]] once again won the sphere from [[Duug]] and found the signature. Looking through the bowl at the environment around it, she saw metal, the sky and clouds from close up. She then blasted it until it broke, flooding the street with a torrent of water before the magic collapses in on itself.
