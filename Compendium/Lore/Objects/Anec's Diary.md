### Description
[[Anec]]'s Diary can be found underneath [[Anec's House]]. It is old and is not great condition, many of the pages are missing or damaged.

It details his obsession with the [[Mark of the Primevals]], his research revealing that they used to be passed down from one chosen to another, only one person can possess them at a time and that if a chosen dies before passing on the mark one must travel to the domain of the Primeval and summon them to attempt to claim the mark. [[Anec]] would then travel through the [[Desolation of Suuhulla]] to the [[Shrine to Scathach]] to attempt to summon [[Scathach]] himself. These pages are in particularly bad condition, but do contain some warnings of the dangers of the area.

After his summoning backfired and started slowly killing him, the diary becomes increasingly rambling as [[Scathach]] takes control of his mind. He talks about finding a dagger and how it whispers to him. He keeps mentioning the dagger wanting to slay a dragon, his writings mentioning this idea more and more. Before he makes it out of the desert his writings start to talk about feeling like he is near death with the final entry reading "and at last I died. and now I understand what they who shall rule the ending requires of me."
