>	You're privileged you know? A thousand thousand years the gods have ruled this world, and you happened to be born just in time to see it all end. Not only the right time, but the perfect place to. I wasn't so lucky, I was born long ago, across the ocean in the depths of desert you'll find where my village stood. It didn't used to be desert of course, it was a forest when I was a child - but the history books have long forgotten them by this point I imagine, after all history is generally maintained by the clerics. And if prophecy says that someone there could some day stand tall enough to threaten the gods themselves, why take a risk?

>	Well 'some day' is here, more than two thousand years I've waited. Slowly, slowly eating away at the structure of my prison. Piece by piece, particle by particle, one by one. The pillar used to shine like a star you know, every colour of the rainbow. Entropy always wins in the end.
>
>	There used to be a god of peace you know, long ago, before even my time. She didn't last long. Why would you worship a god who can't smite your enemies? The gods have to keep you in line, displays of strength to advertise the power they can offer, conveniently double as threats to those who might consider forsaking them. Little caring for the people they devastate in the process. You've probably never seen it living here in a centre of religious favour. But I have. I've walked the streets of the silent city of Kiwydy, I've crossed the poisoned river of Heleah, I saw the desolation of Suuhulla. They need our belief to sustain them, our worship to empower them, and you all let them. Taranis never gains more followers than in aftermath of a hurricane.
>
>	So it all has to go. So it all has to end. So we all have to die. So the gods finally die with us. So the cycle ends. So we can all be free of them. Death will die and I will rise as the new Lord of the Dead and craft a perfect afterlife for all of you. Far away from the tyranny of the gods. And unlike the gods I won't ask for your worship, I won't need to - you'll give it willingly.
