### Description
A Mark of the [[Primevals]] give the bearers powerful magics to help balance the forces of the world. Only one is supposed to hold the mark at time. It may either be passed on willingly with the blessing of the primeval. Or, if a Mark is Lost, one must visit the [[Primevals]] domain and summon them to create a new one. While their existence used to be common knowledge and their bearers public figures, they have since become legend as the marks have been lost for millennia.

#### The Mark of Diracmi

[[Diracmi]]'s Mark has been born by [[Comrath]] for many thousands of years. As a dragon and an archdruid and the bearer of the mark, her life span is hundreds of thousands of years. However, since the fight with [[Il'Zuk]] she hid out on [[Camarath]] to protect his prison and let the secrets of the Marks be lost. She was killed by [[Anec]] with the [[Entropic Dagger]].

#### The Mark of Vacuuous

[[Vacuuous]]' Mark was passed down through those who were most passionate about the stars and space. [[Glikx Tinkervoid|Glikx]] is the current bearer of the mark. But has spent most of the last millennia glitching through time in [[Kaldera]].

#### The Mark of Kairos

[[Kairos]]' Mark was passed down through powerful bloodlines of those with the gift of prophecy. [[Laika Tinkervoid|Laika]] was the last bearer of the mark but was [[Loss of Laika Cutscene|taken by Taranis]] before passing it on. Visiting [[Kairos]]' domain is by far the hardest to do and exactly how it was originally done was a secret lost to time. No-one has been able to find a way to obtain it since.

#### The Mark of Scathach

[[Scathach]]'s Mark is held by [[Aran]], god of death. [[Il'Zuk]] was in life a master of soul magic and on his death started building power in the afterlife by stealing power from other souls. Eventually he became powerful enough to challenge [[Aran]], unable to kill him, he trapped him beyond the event horizon of [[The Dark Storm]] (Which is hell in the afterlife plane) and experimented on him till he was able to copy the mark from the god's soul and bind it to himself.
