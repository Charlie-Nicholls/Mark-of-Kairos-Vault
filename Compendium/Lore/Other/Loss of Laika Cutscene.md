###### Loss of Laika Cutscene
<span class="sub2">:LiNotebookPen: Plan</span>
___

> [!recite|clean no-t]
>	two thousand, one hundred and fourteen years ago.
>
>	A large ship of equal parts wood and steel, 100 foot long and 50 foot wide is violently thrown from side to side. From its midsection extend large metallic wings, like that of a dragon, spread wide to ride the winds of the hurricane; keeping the ship airborne as the clutches of the storm attempt to drag it down. The many sails, usually used to steer the craft, flap uselessly in the wind, many torn, any attempt to direct the ship long since given up. Survival is all that matters now.
> 
>	A woman stands on the bow of the ship, facing back with an overview of the deck with a calm face but frantic hand motions as she instructs the crew. You'd struggle to place her age to look at her. Tall with short cut white hair, smooth skin but old eyes grey eyes. The crew under her command consist not of the usual people or less usual constructs that one might pilot such a vessel with, but a menagerie of animals. Ferrets and foxes scuttle about pulling ropes and dragging tools, above them one of the masts bows and bends dangerously as doves and drakes attempt to man the upper sails. The woman leans over the rail and looks past the lower deck, through an open hatch in the floor and shouts.  
> 	"How are the engines holding up?"
> 
> 	Below decks the veneer of traditional wooden galleon gives way to a cluster of metal and magic machinery. A middle aged gnomish man with dark skin, darker beard and oil stained clothes frantically runs back and forth hammering one thing with a spanner and spanner-ing another with a hammer before berating the squirrel tasked with passing his tools and running back around to do it properly. Hearing the shout from the upper decks he quickly climbs up through the hatch onto the deck.
> 
> 	"Well the anti-gravity propellors are currently holding the space-time envelop stable but the rain and static build up are interfering with the polarity generators, could cause a complete reversal.
> 
> 	The woman thinks for a moment and pushes some rain slicked hair out of her face.
> 
> 	"I have no idea what that means, is it good or bad"  
> 	"No I wouldn't exactly say it was either of those"
> 	"Why do I bother. Laika what's the future looking like?"
> 
> 	Over the shoulder of the gnomish man is a gnomish woman with the same black hair - grown long, a vacant expression on her face, her eyes staring at something that isn't there. Around her neck lies a neckless which holds an infinite hourglass, sand just about to run out and on her finger an ornate ring with a gem prominently embedded into its centre.
> 
> 	"I don't, I can't see. The storm, the chaos, it makes the future unpredictable. A few seconds at most but something, something will be wrong. "
> 
> 	A creaking cracking sound can be heard as the wind batters the mast behind her. As the sand runs out the hourglass on her neck spins around and she grabs hold of it. A light blue glow emanates from her eyes and she says in monotone:
> 
> 	"The war we fight can not be won;
> 	Victory burns out every sun.
> 	Duty must come at a cost,
> 	Chosen fall and caged and wait and lost.
> 	Speak to the bird reborn in flame,
> 	When ending ruler seeks to start their reign."
> 
> 	The creaking cracking sound intensifies as the blue glow clears from her eyes, suddenly she snaps out of the haze and leaps forward, shoving the man off to the side as the mast behind finally gives way and snaps completely. The fabric of the sails it attached to tear as it falls, but holds enough to cause it to swing around the bottom of its arc like a pendulum, swiping Laika like a rag doll up and off the side of the ship before it tears completely.
> 
> 	"LAIKAAA" the man screams are carried away in the wind.
> 
> 	The pale woman immediately runs to the edge of the ship and dives off, even in the panic and the storm, maintaining perfect form.
> 
> 	As she falls, she shifts form; first shrinking down into a falcon in a nose dive. As she spirals she shifts again, growing to an eagle, then a griffin, and finally levelling out as large crystal dragon. She frantically scans the area, looking left and right before finally spotting her. She spins around and chases after her, but it quickly becomes evident, even as she pushes herself to fly ever faster, that she won't catch her before she hits the water. Just before she hits her body seems to vanish. The form of the dragon pierces through the water and looks around confused. She dives and surfaces over and over, searching for the body of her friend but eventually has to give up and return to the ship and shifts back to human and addresses the gnome.  
> 	"I'm sorry. Your sister. She's gone."

### Description
[[Laika Tinkervoid]] deliver's her final [[Laika's Prophecy|prophecy]] before the storm, sent by [[Taranis]] on instruction from [[Scathach]], sweeps her off the deck and she falls to what is believed to be her death. However, she enters the [[Ring of Glikx]] just before she hits the water and [[Taranis]] claims the ring, with [[Laika Tinkervoid|Laika]] inside as he can claim items lost during storms.
