### Description
[[Laika Tinkervoid]]'s last prophecy, produced shortly before she [[Loss of Laika Cutscene|fell from her ship]]. [[Mayastan Daar|Daar]] and [[Phoenix Aevum|Phoenix]] were told this prophecy during [[Arc 1 Session 9]] by [[Glikx Tinkervoid|Glikx]] and [[Comrath]] communicating through time.

### Explanation
1. Two meanings, cannot beat Entropy in the long term, only delay it. And see line 2.
2. Killing a bearer of the [[Mark of the Primevals|Mark of Scathach]] released the [[True Vacuum]].
3. See line 4.
4. Fall -> [[Laika Tinkervoid|Laika]] [[Loss of Laika Cutscene|falls from the boat]] then is trapped falling into [[The Dark Storm]]. 
Caged -> [[Aran]] is caged in [[The Dark Storm]], meant to think it's about [[Il'Zuk]] caged in [[The Eternal Pillar]]. 
Wait - > [[Comrath]] waits on [[Camarath]] for the new chosen of [[Kairos]]. 
Lost -> [[Glikx Tinkervoid|Glikx]] is lost on the city of [[Kaldera]].
5. Speak to [[Phoenix Aevum|Phoenix]] through time, could also be about [[Afel]]?
6. When the campaign takes place.
