### Description
[[Phoenix Aevum|Phoenix]] produced this prophecy in the first loop where he visited the [[Shrine to Kairos]]. He mentioned some of the implications briefly to [[Mayastan Daar|Daar]] when they first met inside the loop. When they reached the [[Shrine to Diracmi]] they found it carved into the walls in draconic, which [[Phoenix Aevum|Phoenix]] immediately deemed as impossible as it had clearly been there since before he produced it. When the time link was established to [[Glikx Tinkervoid|Glikx]] and [[Comrath]] in the past, they told them the prophecy and [[Comrath]] shifted a finger into a claw, carving it into the wall using earth magic in her native draconic.
