### Description
[[Phoenix Aevum|Phoenix]] produced this prophecy in the first loop where he visited the [[Shrine to Kairos]]. He mentioned some of the implications briefly to [[Mayastan Daar|Daar]] when they first met inside the loop. When they reached the [[Shrine of Diracmi]] they found it carved into the walls in draconic, which [[Phoenix Aevum|Phoenix]] immediately deemed as impossible as it had clearly been there since before he produced it. When the time link was established to [[Glikx Tinkervoid|Glikx]] and [[Comrath]] in the past, they told them the prophecy and [[Comrath]] shifted a finger into a claw and carved it into the wall using earth magic in her native draconic.

### Explanation
1. Fairly simple, [[Scathach]] wants to bring about a state of maximum entropy
2. Is talking about [[Il'Zuk]] dying to cast [[True Vacuum]], but could also be intepreted as talking about [[Phoenix Aevum|Phoenix]]
3. Should read "Change's Chosen shall find the city lost in time" referring to [[Kaldera]]
4. Should read "He'll sail where no light may shine", meaning [[The Dark Storm]]
5. Past the event horizon of [[The Dark Storm]]
6. Free [[Aran]] from his prison in [[The Dark Storm]] and receive the true [[Mark of the Primevals|Mark of Scathach]] for [[Mayastan Daar|Daar]]
7. [[Glikx Tinkervoid|Glikx]] or [[Mata Starheart|Mata]] if the mark is transferred, [[Phoenix Aevum|Phoenix]], [[Mayastan Daar|Daar]] once [[Scathach]]'s mark is passed and [[Comrath]] when resurrected
8. Big Bang new universe in the [[Ring of Glikx]]
9. [[Il'Zuk]] and/or [[Mayastan Daar|Daar]] will die in the final fight
10. Could either mean [[Mayastan Daar|Daar]] has a choice to sacrifice themselves to save the world OR more likely, learns [[Il'Zuk]]'s death will release the [[True Vacuum]] in whatever universe he is in, so can chose to eject him and damn [[Tellus]] or destroy the universe they just made, which will have life (albeit way less as it's smaller) and they will rule as gods
