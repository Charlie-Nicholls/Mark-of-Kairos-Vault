> [!recite|clean no-t]
>	The Eternal Pillar stands tall in the centre of Camarath Square, seeming to burst up from the ground to heights taller than any building. Midnight black and smooth like obsidian, shaped like a narrow flame. It's been there for longer than civilisation, no-one has ever been able to damage it and no-one knows where it came from or what it is.

### Description

The Eternal Pillar is what is left of the [[Great Sword Supernova]]. Wielded by [[Comrath]] and adapted by [[Glikx Tinkervoid]] to contain an extradimensional prison in which [[Il'Zuk]] was trapped.  He has spent thousands of years using his entropic magic to slowly degrade its structure and therefore its magic. [[Comrath]] kept guard over the pillar for centuries, using her atomic magic to restore structure to the pillar periodically, but since her death [[Il'Zuk]] has been able to degrade the magic freely. Originally the structure of the crystal meant it scattered light like a prism, shining like a rainbow, but having lost its structure it now appears entirely black. The surface was originally marked with thousands of runic symbols to reinforce the magic but this too has been smoothed out by the increase in entropy. 

At about 6:00 on the day of the founding festival, the decay reaches a critical point, allowing [[Il'Zuk]] to break free. The pillar splinters, shards flying off into the crowd at high speed, before the base gives way and it collapses onto the nearby buildings. [[Il'Zuk]] will use the shards of the pillar, restored by [[Comrath]]'s breath, to power the summoning of [[The Dark Storm]] to [[Camarath]] as they still hold in them the energy of the first supernova.
