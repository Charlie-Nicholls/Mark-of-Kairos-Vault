### Description
[[Anec]] lives in a nondescript house in the south of the Noble's district. Where the other members of the [[Hand of Twilight]] have large houses, identifying his house from the outside is virtually impossible, and only the other member's of the [[Hand of Twilight]] know where it is.

Inside the house looks remarkably unlived in, bed still made, no plates and no possessions strewn about. As an undead, [[Anec]] does not need to sleep or eat.

A **DC 10** investigation check reveals  might find rotten food in the pantry or mould growing in the bathroom.

A **DC 15** investigation check, or **DC 10** specifically in the bathroom, reveals one a few tiles where the mould is much cleaner. These can be removed, leading to a dark and dingy 30 ft. ladder down to an underground cavern where Anec spends most of his time in the house.

10ft. of the way down the ladder, one of the rungs has many short and fine needles tipped with poison embedded into the roots. Stepping on this rung without sturdy shoes or grasping it with your hand requires a creature to make a **DC11** Constitution saving throw or take 2d8 poison damage and be Poisoned for an hour, half as much on a successful save. Subsequently a **DC 15** Dexterity saving throw must be made or fall 20 ft. off the ladder, taking 2d6 bludgeoning damage. The trap can be detected by making a **DC 15** Wisdom (Perception) check while descending the ladder.

He spends most of his time in down here amongst death and decay. Down here [[Anec's Diary]] can be found along with his plans for the day of the [[Founding Festival]].
