#### Choices

Make sure player choices have large effects on the plot. Some points can be kept flexible to allow for freeform player choices. Plot hooks can often be danged by offering players bad choices as they can rarely resist. 
But even when players need to be kept more strictly on plot, make sure to plan points where players are given choices that have large effects on the direction of the story. Or key points where there are multiple outcomes (success/failure/partial success/only some goals possible) which have long term effects. If these choices can speak to established aspects or the morality of characters even better.

#### Combat

See [[Encounter Design]]

#### Conspiracy

A conspiracy is essentially an optional side-plot that I can quickly and easily attach to a random NPC. It doesn't have to be fancy, but it should be sneaky, and cool. And most importantly, there needs to be room at the lower levels of the conspiracy for random NPCs to be "in on it". A good conspiracy should also have a handful of proper name NPCs the players may have heard of involved. Can be pulled out whenever PCs investigate something random they think is suspicious that wasn't planned.

#### Description

When describing new areas, start with the details and end with the major details. E.g. if you've walked into a room with a big monster, describe the room and the environment and end with mentioning the big monster. This way players begin to have ideas about they can do in the environment before learning about the focus rather than starting to think about how they'll deal with the major focus while you're still describing the details and missing them completely.

#### Downtime

Build in some time for players to interact without any immediate danger or looming deadlines. Minimum when getting a long rest prompt them to talk to each other or ask what they're character is doing in their free time.

#### Let Player Negotiate

If players come up with something unexpected that you aren't completely sure how to rule. Ask them what they want to happen as a result of the thing they're trying. From there you can negotiate and make clear what DC they need to hit for what effect. Often if they are asking for a major upside it is a good idea to ad a minimum DC to not have some significant negative effect. If it makes no sense or is game breaking in a way you aren't prepared to have happen, then don't be afraid to just rule it as a no. But if it is something that you are okay with happening but is extremely hard or unlikely, you can always just ask for a Nat 20, being given a chance, even a small one, usually make the players feel like they have agency and when that Nat 20 does happen it will be very memorable. 

#### Shoot You Monks

Try to design elements of your encounters and scenarios that play into the abilities and character fantasies of the players. Do not play around their abilities unless the enemies would know to do that, if anything play into them.

#### Vary Challenges

Each quest should have some a variety of elements. Try to ensure each has a mix of combat, puzzles, social encounters and exploration. If challenges can be overcome in multiple ways even better.

#### Villains

Make sure villains have some presence throughout the story and don't just appear for the final fight. It's far more satisfying for players to beat them if they've had encounters with them before where they frustrate/taunt/defeat them.
