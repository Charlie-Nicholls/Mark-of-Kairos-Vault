### Environment

What can be interacted with in the environment? Can players use their turn to do something to the playing field that's worth it to spend their action doing? Have an idea of how much damage, what status effects or useful changes could be achieved from players improvising something to do with the environment. E.g. have a rule of cool range of damage per level something not in the rules could do.

Instead of every fight being a reskin of a wide open field, are there obstacles, height differences, advantageous positions, points for cover, unexplored branches, etc?

Does the environment change over time or have some effect at the end of a round? This can provide a sense of urgency for the fight and/or affect the [[#Secondary Objective]].

### Secondary Objective

### General

- The first round of combat should be the enemies at their most powerful, use recharge abilities and scare them. Can ease off afterwards to give a sense of overcoming odds. Ideally have another power spike when the enemy is nearing death.
