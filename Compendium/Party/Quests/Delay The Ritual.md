 - [ ] Kill [[Anec]]
 - [ ] Evacuate The Astral Scryers
 - [ ] Destroy The [[Shrine to Kairos]]
 - [ ] Prevent The Resurrection of [[Comrath]]

### Stages
 - [ ] Stage 1

### Plan

#### Kill [[Anec]] and [[Boda]]
[[Boda]] was killed in the previous loop and her body kept in the [[Ring of Glikx]], so her soul will become disconnected from her body at the start of the final timeline. This functionally removes her from consideration for the first day of the final timeline, but as a advanced soul mage, her memories of previous loops returns before she is dragged to the afterlife and she is able to bind herself to the material plane with her desire for revenge. Starting weak, she will stalk [[Mayastan Daar|Daar]] and [[Phoenix Aevum|Phoenix]], slowly becoming stronger.

[[Anec]] starts the day at [[Anec's House]], leaving at 10.00 and arriving at [[Ulrach's Clock Shop]] at 10.30. He runs the Cult meeting 11.15 when he activates the magical poison and attempts to being the ritual. Without [[Boda]] he cannot perform the ritual himself, so instead ties up the cultists ready for [[Il'Zuk]] to sacrifice after he rises. Leaving early than planned at 11.30 to go to [[Camarath Observatory]]. Without [[Mata Starheart|Mata]] there he instead takes the key to the [[Shrine to Vacuuous]] and ambushes a couple of astral scryers to attempt to map out [[The Dark Storm]], but this takes much longer than with [[Mata Starheart|Mata]]. When [[Il'Zuk]] rises he plans to be there to pass on any ritual ingredients he has obtained and to fight the rest of the [[Hand of Twilight]].

#### Evacuate The Astral Scryers
There are seven trained Astral Scryers working for [[Camarath Observatory]]. 
- [[Mata Starheart]] - Observatory head
- [[Domne]] - Senior Scryer - Working until 1pm - [[Crystal Dragon Library]] 1.30pm - 4pm - [[Camarath Square]] 4.30pm - 6pm
- [[Candua]] - Senior Scryer - Working all day
- [[Brigi]] - Senior Scryer - Day off - Market's Hill 9.00am - 11.00am, [[Scholar's District]] 11.30am - 1pm, [[Camarath Square]] 1.30 - 5pm, Hatter's District 5 - 6pm
- [[Aingen]] - Junior Scryer - Day off - Guild District 9.00am - 10.00am, Walled Market 10.30am - 12.00pm. [[Scholar's District]] 12.30pm - 3pm, [[Camarath Square]] 3.30pm - 6pm.
- [[Lici]] -  Junior Scryer - Tour leader
- [[Duina]] - Student - Tour leader

If enough of these scryers are taken by [[Il'Zuk]] or [[Anec]] they will be able to map out [[The Dark Storm]]. [[Mata Starheart|Mata]] is capable of doing so alone in 2 hours. Two senior Scryers would take 2.5 hours each. and 4 Junior/Student Scryers would take 3 hours each. If enough of the scryers can be evacuated or are killed before the mapping, this will successfully delay the ritual until [[Il'Zuk]] can find more trained Scryers.

#### Destroy The [[Shrine to Kairos]]
[[Boda]]'s death will prevent [[Anec]] from performing the sacrifice for the [[Bottle of Age]], but [[Il'Zuk]] will be easily capable of this once he has risen. The only way to prevent this long term is to destroy the [[Shrine to Kairos]] to force him to travel to the next nearest shrine. 

#### Prevent The Resurrection of [[Comrath]]
