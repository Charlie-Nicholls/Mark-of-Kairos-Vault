### Plan

#### Stealth Rolls
- Undead Vulture sees them and needs to be killed before it can report
- Large procession of Zombies, need to blend in to sneak through

#### Rescues
##### [[Hill District]]
- [[Boda]] has risen as undead and is attacking the people of [[Kiriel's Whisper]], attacking their souls.
- Rescuing the people of [[Kiriel's Whisper]] confers the blessing of [[Kiriel]]
- Saving [[Boda]]'s soul from [[Il'Zuk]]'s possession confers the blessing of [[Xonera]]

##### [[Monument District]]
- Undead termites have swarmed the various statues and have eaten away at them. [[Cerio]] is desperately using his mending magic to maintain [[Statue of Eron]] but it is draining and the termites are beginning to attack him too. If he is not convinced to leave he will be killed.
- Rescuing [[Cerio]] or saving the statue confers the blessing of [[Eron]]

##### [[Noble's District]]
- [[Crochna]] (old ranger lady) [[Lachi]] (Paladin of [[Zeriel]]) in a final stand, attempting to protect a group of nobles from the undead ([[Vella]] should be one of them)
- Saving [[Lachi]] confers the blessing of [[Zeriel]]

##### [[Sentry District]]
- The [[Temple of Afel]] and the [[Afel's Rebirth]] are on fire. [[Ethwyst]] will die trying to save everyone inside if Daar doesn’t help.
- Saving [[Ethwyst]] or enough civilians confers the blessing of [[Afel]]

##### [[Scholar's District]]
- The [[Crystal Dragon Library]] collapsed after [[Comrath]] burst through the ceiling. [[Sine]] and their cat are trapped under the rubble.
- Rescuing [[Sine]]'s cat confers the blessing of [[Gagavr]]

##### [[Camarath Square]]
- [[Il'Zuk]] & [[Comrath]] setting up in the center, huge numbers of undead are there. [[Comrath]] is restoring the great sword supernova.

---

#### Final Confrontation
- [[Il'Zuk]] will want to take the clerics/paladins alive to witness his victory. He will deal non lethal damage to [[Mayastan Daar|Daar]] & [[Phoenix Aevum|Phoenix]] if at all possible.
- [[Il'Zuk]] will give his [[Il'Zuk's Speech|Speech]]

The final stand will take place at the [[Camarath Square]] as [[The Dark Storm]] is summoned to earth. After [[Aran]] has touched [[Il'Zuk]], [[Scathach]] will begin to leech into the city as his power builds. He will see the time loop for what it is and begin to decay it. [[Mayastan Daar|Daar]] will be the only one capable of moving through the storm. [[Mayastan Daar|Daar]] will have to brave the storm to kill [[Phoenix Aevum|Phoenix]] and reset the loop. Or he could attempt to accelerate [[Il'Zuk]]'s death but this will be harder. The gods will act through the clerics he has been able to save to give him a blessing. James can spend these to add a d6 to a roll

Il'Zuk will focus the dark storm on Phoenix to attack his mind (stops him hurting himself). When Daar reaches phoenix, unless done incredibly quickly, will have to decide between spending the time to heal phoenix's mind, but letting the time loop be shattered (Resetting one final time) or Killing him and preserving the loop but damaging phoenix's mind in some way (He will be reset to as he was pre looping but James doesn't know this). If James fails badly then both can occur. [[Comrath]] will start to fall apart as [[Il'Zuk]] cannot maintain concentration.

##### Blessing
- For each cleric saved [[Mayastan Daar]] will receive a blessing in the final fight. Starts with [[Taranis]]'s Blessing.
- Each blessing is a d8 which can be spent to roll and add to any roll
- Expected to get 4-6

##### Challenges
0. **DC 25** Charisma saving throw against the storm. Choose to fail or lose a turn remembering [[Taranis]]'s instructions
1. Escaping Undead Guards **DC 10** Strength saving throw
2. Charm or resist the souls of the dead  **DC 15** Persuasion (Charisma) or Charm Person or Charisma saving through)
3. [[Il'Zuk]] uses Paralyzing Touch (Paralyzing Touch: Melee Spell Attack: +12 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. Hit: 10 (3d6) cold damage. The target must succeed on a **DC 18** Constitution saving throw or be paralyzed for 1 minute. The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.)
4. [[Comrath]] Uses her breath weapon. **DC 18** Dexterity saving throw to dodge it and stay on track or blown back.
5. [[Il'Zuk]] uses power word stun (Or has used it on phoenix?) (You speak a word of power that can overwhelm the mind of one creature you can see within range, leaving it dumbfounded. If the target has 150 hit points or fewer, it is stunned. Otherwise, the spell has no effect. The stunned target must make a **DC20** Constitution saving throw at the end of each of its turns. On a successful save, this stunning effect ends.)
