### Plan

#### Intro - Sneaking out of the Academy of the Devout

"I don't know how I let you talk me into these things".

Â You can't seem to focus for a moment, everything is hazy. You're back in the academy - no, you're in the academy - no, you're sneaking out of the academy. You look down at your friend and everything suddenly snaps into a blurry focus. He's tall and lanky with golden scales covered by a dark cloak instead of his usual gleaming armour.

"Come on, we've got to get down to the docks before someone notices"

#### Meeting Taranis

All around you the frayed edges of rope begins to stand on end. The nodes in your throat that create your breath attack hum in sympathy. Looking up you see directly above you an arc of lightning begins to streak down towards your mast. What would normally be over in a flash seems to take longer, the lightning seeming to slow as it travels.

"We have until the lightning strikes".

Before you stands a man with with medium length hair, white and slightly singed, each hair pointing resolutely in a different direction as if he'd just been eletrocuted. His eyes are light blue but even as you look into them their shade shifts, first darker then lighter again.

#### Waking Up

Cold water splashes into your face causing you to bolt upright, suddenly awake.
